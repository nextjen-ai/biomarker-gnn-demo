# Biomarker-Disease Prediction Demo

A demonstration project for predicting disease risks using biomarker data and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs).

## Project Overview

This demo project shows how to:
1. Process biomarker data from the UCI Heart Disease dataset
2. Build a knowledge graph connecting biomarkers and diseases
3. Visualize the relationships between biomarkers and diseases
4. (Coming soon) Train a GNN to predict disease risks

## Current Progress

### Completed
- âœ… Data processing pipeline for heart disease dataset
- âœ… Knowledge graph construction
- âœ… Graph visualization
- âœ… Node feature analysis

### In Progress
- ðŸ”„ GNN model development
- ðŸ”„ Training pipeline
- ðŸ”„ Prediction system

## Setup

Simply run:
```bash
uv sync
```

This will:
- Create a virtual environment
- Install all dependencies
- Create a lockfile for reproducibility

## Next Steps

1. GNN Model Development
   - Implement graph neural network architecture
   - Add node and edge feature processing
   - Set up training pipeline

2. Training and Evaluation
   - Train the model on the knowledge graph
   - Implement evaluation metrics
   - Add cross-validation

3. Prediction System
   - Create prediction interface
   - Add confidence scoring
   - Implement visualization of predictions

## Data Sources

- UCI Heart Disease Dataset
  - Contains biomarker measurements
  - Includes disease presence/absence
  - Clean, processed data

## Visualization

The project includes two types of visualizations:
1. Knowledge Graph Visualization
   - Shows relationships between biomarkers and diseases
   - Edge weights indicate relationship strength
   - Different colors for different node types

2. Node Feature Analysis
   - Statistical properties of biomarkers
   - Disease prevalence and severity
   - Feature importance analysis
